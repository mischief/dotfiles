I like the ShowMarks plugin vimscript #152 ,but he has some bug in Vim 7,so I patch and upload it.

ShowMarks provides a visual representation of the location marks.
Marks are useful for jumping back and forth between interesting points in a buffer, but can be hard to keep track of without any way to see where you have placed them.  ShowMarks hopefully makes life easier by placing a sign in the leftmost column of the buffer.  The sign indicates the label of the mark and its location.
It can be toggled on and off and individual marks can be hidden(effectively removing them).

ShowMarks requires that Vim is compiled with the +signs feature.
